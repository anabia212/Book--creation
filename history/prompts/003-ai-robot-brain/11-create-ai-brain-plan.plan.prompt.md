# Prompt

```
Module 3 — Plan

Extend the existing Docusaurus site structure and update sidebars to include Module 3.

Add Module 3 with three chapters as .md files: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data, Isaac ROS and Accelerated Perception, and Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation.
```

# Response

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the AI-Robot Brain module (NVIDIA Isaac™). The plan includes:

## Implementation Plan
- Extended existing Docusaurus setup to include Module 3
- Defined technical context with JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and web-based deployment
- Ensured compliance with all constitutional principles

## Research Findings
- Confirmed extending existing Docusaurus setup as the appropriate approach
- Researched content organization structure for educational modules
- Investigated NVIDIA Isaac Sim capabilities and integration approaches
- Researched Isaac ROS and Nav2 implementation patterns

## Data Model
- Defined entities for the course module structure
- Created specific entities for each of the three chapters
- Established navigation structure for the sidebar

## Quickstart Guide
- Provided instructions for extending existing Docusaurus setup
- Created step-by-step guide for adding Module 3 content
- Included sidebar configuration updates
- Included development and deployment instructions

## API Contracts
- Created content API contract for potential future RAG integration
- Defined endpoints for retrieving educational content
- Ensured contract supports the project's educational goals

The plan is fully aligned with the project constitution and ready for the implementation phase.

# Outcome

The implementation plan for the AI-Robot Brain module is complete and ready for development. All necessary artifacts have been created including the plan, research, data model, quickstart guide, and API contracts.

# Evaluation

The plan successfully addresses all requirements from the user input: extending the existing Docusaurus setup, creating three chapters as .md files, and updating the sidebar for Module 3. All constitutional principles have been validated and the plan is ready for the next phase.
