Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This course focuses on embodied intelligence and AI systems operating in the physical world.

## Course Modules

This course is organized into several modules that build upon each other:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robots
- **Module 2**: [Coming Soon] - Advanced topics in humanoid robotics
- **Module 3**: [Coming Soon] - AI integration with physical systems

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to learn about ROS 2, the middleware nervous system of humanoid robots, enabling communication, control, and embodiment of AI agents in physical systems.
